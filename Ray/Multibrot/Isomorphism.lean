## Böttcher coordinates form an isomorphism between the exterior Multibrot set and the unit disk

We show that

1. `(c,c)` is postcritical for each `c` not in the Multibrot set.  To see this, note that `0` and
   `∞` are the only critical points of `f z = z^d + c`, and `c` is postcritical since it is the
   image of `0` (and thus has smaller potential).
2. Therefore, the diagonal Böttcher map `bottcher d c = s.bottcher c c` is analytic throughout
   the exterior of the Multibrot set.
3. `bottcher d` is nontrivial throughout the exterior of the Multibrot set, as otherwise triviality
   spreads throughout `𝕊`.
4. `bottcher d` bijects from the exterior of the Multibrot set to `ball 0 1`.
5. There is an explicit, analytic homeomorphism `bottcherHomeomorph d` from the exterior of the
   Multibrot set to `ball 0 1`.

Connectivity of the Multibrot set and its complement are easy consequences of (5); see
`Multibrot/Connected.lean` and `Mandelbrot.lean`.

## Injectivity of Böttcher coordinates
-/

/-- `bottcher d` is injective.

    We use induction on potential down 0, expressed using closed sets of pairs.  Intuitively,
    1. Near 0, `bottcher d` is injective since it is noncritical.
    2. The set of potentials with an injectivity counterexample is open.
    3. A limit of counterexamples is either already a counterexample, or shows that `bottcher d`
       is critical at the limit.
    4. But every value is repeated near critical points of analytic functions, so in particular
       smaller values are repeated, which gives us a smaller potential counterexample. -/
